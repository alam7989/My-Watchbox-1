### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Entertainment
- **Mobile:**
    - this is more than just a glorified website, since it will store information about the user that they may want to check and update often
    - it will include a map/location feature, and can also use real-time features
- **Story:**
    - this app is not too valuable, more just for entertainment and fun
    - I think my friends and peers would appreciate this product
- **Market:**
    - the potential user base is very large and diverse, since many people watch movies/shows
    - this could provide some value to many people, but probably only a niche group of people would highly value it (people who really enjoy movies/shows)
    - the audience is not very well-defined, and is fairly broad
- **Habit:**
    - the app will probably not be addictive, but will be used repeatedly
        * it will probably have high retention rate, since users will not want to lose the movie/show details that they spent time entering into the app
    - the average user will create a lot, since they will enter in the details of what they are watching
- **Scope:**
    - this should be technically challenging
    - it will be interesting to build, with tableviews, editing, and location features
    - the base application is fairly clearly defined
