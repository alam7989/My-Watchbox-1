**Evaluation**
---------
* Productivity Log
    * mobile: 
        * this is more than just a glorified website, since it will store information about the user that they will likely want to check and update often
        * does not use any of the suggested features
    * story:
        * is fairly valuable to the audience
        * I think my friends and peers would appreciate this product
    * market:
        * the potential user base is very large and diverse
        * this could provide a lot of value to a non-niche group of people
        * audience is not very well-defined, and is fairly broad
    * habit:
        * users may feel compelled to use the app a lot to make sure they remain productive
        * the average user will create a lot, since they must enter the details of their productivity
    * scope:
        * this should be mildly technically challenging
        * it can be interesting to build, with tableviews and calendar features
        * the base application is fairly clearly defined, but it has the potential to expand and have many additional features
    
    
* Watchlist Tracker
    * mobile: 
        * this is more than just a glorified website, since it will store information about the user that they may want to check and update often
        * it will include a map/location feature, and can also use real-time features
    * story:
        * is not too valuable, more just for entertainment and fun
        * I think my friends and peers would appreciate this product
    * market:
        * the potential user base is very large and diverse, since many people watch movies/shows
        * this could provide some value to many people, but probably only a niche group of people would highly value it (people who really enjoy movies/shows)
        * audience is not very well-defined, and is fairly broad
    * habit:
        * probably not addictive, but will be used repeatedly
            * probably has high retention rate, since users will not want to lose the movie/show details that they spent time entering into the app
        * the average user will create a lot, since they will enter in the details of what they are watching
    * scope:
        * this should be technically challenging
        * it can be interesting to build, with tableviews, editing, and location features
        * the base application is fairly clearly defined
